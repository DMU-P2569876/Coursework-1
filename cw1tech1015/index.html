    <p> Like all the men in his family, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) possesses the power to travel in time.
       With the advice of his father, he uses his special ability to pursue his romantic interest, Mary (Rachel McAdams).
     It's not all plain sailing though - with the curve balls that life throws at you, trying to change the outcome has
   a knock on effect and twists Tims life in ways he didn't plan. </p>
